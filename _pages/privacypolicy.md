## Information We Collect

We do not collect, store, or process any personal information or user data through the Mindfuzz app. We do not have servers that collect or store your information.

## Third-Party Server Connections

Mindfuzz is designed to connect to your own Jellyfin or Subsonic media servers to stream music. When you use the app:

- Connection details (server URL, username, password) are stored locally on your device only
- Music streaming occurs directly between your device and your configured server
- We do not have access to, collect, or store any information about your media servers, login credentials, or streaming activity
- All communication with your media servers is handled directly by your device

## How We Use Information

Since we do not collect any information, we do not use, share, or process any personal data.

## Data Storage

All app data (including server connection settings) is stored locally on your device only. No user data is stored on our servers or transmitted to us.

## Third-Party Services

Mindfuzz does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The app only connects to user-configured Jellyfin or Subsonic servers that you own or have access to, Lidarr servers that you own or have access to, and optionally, Last.FM for scrobbling and music statistics.

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not collect any information from users of any age, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app and will be effective immediately upon posting.
